#### Welcome to Smartdown/Impress

The source for this presentation is in the [smartdown/impress](https://github.com/smartdown/impress) repository and contains a subset of the Smartdown example in the official [Smartdown Gallery](https://smartdown.github.io/gallery/#Home).

This particular project is mostly to exercise Smartdown in the context of [Impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js), to shake out any bugs that show up in this more challenging environment. For example, some of the Disclosable features don't work properly in Slides.
